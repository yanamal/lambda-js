        <div>
            <b>Functional programming</b> asks (among other things): What if functions could also be used as values?
            <br/>
            <b>Lambda Calculs</b> asks: What if functions were <em>the only kind of value</em> you could have? What if <em>everything</em> was functions?
        </div>

        <div>
            For example, let's say we want to represent boolean logic using lambda calculus. Operators like AND, OR, NOT would of course be functions. 
            <br/>
            But so would the values TRUE and FALSE! They are functions defined in a very clever way, such that any valid boolean expression actually does evaluate to the correct TRUE or FALSE value/function/thing. 
        </div>

        <div>
            TRUE is defined as <code><b>(&lambda;x. &lambda;y. x)</b></code>.  This means that it takes one argument (x), then takes another argument(y), and returns the first argument.
            <br/>
            FALSE is the opposite: it returns the second argument.
        </div>

        <div>
            Lambda calculus is actually quite simple to evaluate. There are really only two things you can do:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Replace</b> a symbol with its definition. For example:
                    <br/>
                    <code><b>TRUE</b> THING_A THING_B</code> &#10230 <br/>
                    <code><b>(&lambda;x. &lambda;y. x)</b> THING_A THING_B</code>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Apply</b> a value to a lambda argument. You take the firsst thing <b>after</b> of a lambda expression, and then use it to replace the first lambda variable <b>inside</b> of that expression. 
                    For example:
                    <br>
                    <code>(<b>&lambda;x.</b> &lambda;y. x) <b>THING_A</b> THING_B</code> &#10230 <br/>
                    <code>(&lambda;y. <b>THING_A</b>)  THING_B </code>
                    <br>
                    Yes, the function goes inside the parentheses,but the values for arguments go outside of them! It's a bit unusual, but it makes a lot of sense once you get used to it.
                </li>
            </ol>
            If you keep doing that in the right order to a well-formed expression, you should eventually arrive at the correct answer.
            <br/>
            "Wait, what do you mean by the <em>right</em> order?!" - you might be asking.
            <br/>
            Well, if you get unlucky with your choice of order, it's possible to run into infinite expansion loops and never get anywhere useful. 
            <br/>
            For this reason, a common convention is to always replace or apply the <b>left-most</b> thing you can do that operation to. And this <em>usually</em> works out fine.
        </div>
        <h2>Try it out!</h2>
        <div>
            Enough words! Below are links to some interactive examples of using lambda calculus for simple boolean logic.
            In these visualizations, the <b>Replace</b> step is done automatically for you. 
            You will have to trigger each <b>Apply</b> step by clicking on the <em>value</em> which should be applied to a lambda variable.
        </div>

        <!--div>
            In these examples, all the symbols are renamed slightly to emphasize what they do as functions. For example, TRUE and FALSE are renamed into TRUE and FALSE.

        <h4>Or</h4>
        Left as a (paper-based) exercise for the user.
        <br/>
        Can you figure out what OR should be, based on how NOT and AND work?
